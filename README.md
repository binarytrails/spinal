# Spinal

Spinal helps you to “hear” your spine condition. This wearable technology serves as an amplifying interface for the spine. Your spine allows you to move and feel due to its major role in the nervous system. This project aims to raise awareness about your spine by creating a shape-shifting interface of communication which can adapt to any spine. In order to prevent an ongoing deterioration, Spinal will help your spine to manifest its condition using a real-time 3D OpenGL visualisation. This wearable wireless piece can serve both medical and artistic purposes.

## Roadmap

- ~~Visualization~~
- ~~Serial communication~~
- ~~Real-time eulier angles~~
- Calibrations
- Spine reconstruction
    - ~~Artificial using Catmull-Rom Spline~~
    - Real based on mathematical model
- User interactions
